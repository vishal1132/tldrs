* always watch out for allocations, and things escaping to heap. Copying an element is unnecessary when you already have the original item's lifetime greater than or equal to the lifetime of the element being copied. if you have a long living array, and you want to return a pointer to an element of that array, don't `r:=res[i], return &r`. This way you will be copying the res[i] from heap to stack and then since you are returning a pointer to that, that copied value needs to escape to heap as well. So, probably like- `r:=&res[i], return r` is a better way to do that. What's escaping to heap and what's not are optimization decisions at compile time. You can view them by `go build -gcflags=-m <>`. To pass multiple `gcflags`, you can for example- `go build -gcflags="-m -r" <>`. `-m` is to print optimization decisions, `-r` is to enable race detector.
