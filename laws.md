Moore's Law-
computing power increases by 100% every 18 months. which means nearly 60% increment in performance every year.

Proebsting's Law-
Compilers double in performance every 18 years, which means 4% improvement every year.

**Which means Programming Language Research should be concentrating on something other than optimizations. Perhaps programmer productivity is a more fruitful arena.**

Amdahl's Law-
Suppose there is a routine which takes `s` amount of time doing serial work and p amount of work can be parallelized. So you can at best improve performance by 1/s no matter how many cores you use.
