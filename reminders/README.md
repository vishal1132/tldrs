### Things to be constantly reminded about.
We all know things just not enough for our subconscious brain to remind us when we need them the most. This is an attempt to register these in my subconscious mind.

Combining [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier/) with say(for long notifications) and [jobber](https://dshearer.github.io/jobber/).

### Example-

### Remind Me script
remind me script to add a reminder from anywhere under a known markdown top headline. (poor man's CLI).
